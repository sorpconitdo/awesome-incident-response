        !NoMusic (i) // 1 - disable all sounds
        !UseDeveloperKeys () // enable developer keys

        !RenderComments () // enable rendering of comments
        !NoLogos () // disables logos at game start

        // _LOG_INFOS = 0x04, _LOG_TESTS = 0x08 
        // (used in ShowInfo methods, debug console)
        !ConsoleCommand (s) // Defines console command that will be run at the begging of the game 
        // or after pressing numpad subtract key. There can be more than one command 
        // and the order of call is the same as they are defined in script.
        !EnableAudioLog () // Enables logging of audio errors/events to file 
        !ChromeSpyHost (s) // ChromeSpy host machine name (default: localhost)
        !ChromeSpyPort (i) // ChromeSpy port (default: 8086)
        
        ConsoleCommand (s)
        NoLogos ()
        Cheats ()
        UseDeveloperKeys ()
        //UseFKeysWithCtrl ()
        
        //ChromeSpyHost ("localhost")
        //ChromeSpyPort (8086)
        
        //!AutostartServer ()
        //AutostartLevel ("Woodyard_startprop.scr")
        // ----- EndCheatbook--------------------------
3. Save the file and place it in your game directory, which should be something like Sniper Ghost WarriorGame.
4. Start the game and press [Esc] to access the KI Debug menu and Dev menu.
5. From there, you can enable various cheats, such as "God Mode", "Cheat Mode", "Magic Ammo", "Charge Full", "Restore Health", "Give Ammo", "Give Rifle", "Give Grenades", "Kill Enemies" and more.

Enjoy your enhanced gameplay and have fun!

If you want to learn more about the game and its features, you can check out some of the following tips and tricks:

- If you approach certain rocks when in crouch mode, you can actually enter them and not be seen. This is a great way to shoot enemies without being killed. However, not all rocks will work, so you have to experiment a bit.
- If you want to unlock Steam achievements, you have to complete certain tasks in the game. For example, to get the "Fallen Eagle" achievement, you have to kill 10 birds. To get the "Flying Knives" achievement, you have to kill 10 enemies with throwing knives. To get the "General" achievement, you have to finish the game on Hard difficulty.
- If you want to improve your sniping skills, you have to pay attention to some factors that affect your accuracy and performance. For example, the wind direction and speed, the distance to your target, the bullet drop and the breathing control. You can use the binoculars to measure the distance and the wind indicator to see the wind direction and speed. You can also hold your breath by pressing [Shift] to steady your aim and reduce the sway of your rifle.

With these tips and cheats, you should be able to master Sniper: Ghost Warrior and enjoy its thrilling gameplay. Have fun!
